# Clothes Classification (Deep Learning):
**Development Stack:**
1. Tensorflow (Low level API for Machine Learning).
2. Tensorflow-lite (For inference only).
3. Keras (High level API on top of tensorflow).
4. Xception (As a pre-trained model from ImageNet).

**Deployment Stack:**
1. Docker (making the service self-contained).
2. AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) (Hosting Docker container on Cloud).
3. AWS Lambda (an event-driven, serverless computing platform provided by AWS).
4. AWS API Gateway (To access a Web-Service and send requests over HTTP)
